CORE - PERIPHERY DETECTION BY SURPRISE
This file quickly explains how to run our code for detection of mesoscale scructures.

%%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%%
REQUIREMENTS:
Python 3.5 or higher
several packages as detailed in the script

%%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%%
A quick instroduction into Jupyter Notebooks:
We supply the Python code in the form of a Jupyter notebook. This is an interactive
program that runs in your internet browser [offline] and can execute python scripts
line-by-line. If you do not have Python installed, the easiest way is to install
Anaconda. This is a free prepacked version of python with a lot of packages already
installed, including Jupyter Notebooks.
If you have already installed Python, you can simply install Jupyter notebooks with pip,
see http://jupyter.org/install for step-by-step instructions.

Please see https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/running.html#running for more details
on running a Jupyter notebook.

Script:
The script contains all necesarry functions. To run the algorithm please run all the
functions in the script and then follow the directions to load your own data. The script
also provides several examples. Please see the provided Jupyter Notebook for all details
on how to run the functions and which output is given.
